  <h1 class="post-title">Hello Myo</h1>
  <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2014</span>
  <p>After a year of waiting, the <a href="https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/">Myo</a> finally arrived.  In the year of waiting for it, there has been many different projects I&#39;ve
been wanting to undertake.  The initial step: writing a Ruby wrapper to interact with Myo.</p>

<h4>Myo Ruby Wrapper</h4>

<p>When I finally received notification that the Myo had shipped, I began to do some cursory research on what libraries existed and if there were any in Ruby.  At the time there weren&#39;t so I created a Ruby gem but hadn&#39;t bothered to push it since I had no physical Myo to interact with.</p>

<p>Instead I cloned the Python libray (Myo-python) and began to read through it and the iOS sdk.  And tonight when I got home from a trip to Kyoto and Nara, the Myo was waiting.</p>

<h4>Simple Beginnings</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://https://github.com/bgmarx/myo-ruby-wrapper">Myo Ruby Wrapper</a> is very much a work in progress but I have managed to get be able to read various events from the Myo using the <a href="https://github.com/mwylde/em-websocket-client">EM Websocket Client Gem</a> and parsing the JSON responses.  Each message from the myo is an array like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">[
  &quot;event&quot;,
  {
    &quot;myo&quot;:0,
    &quot;timestamp&quot;:&quot;52593461767&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;:&quot;paired&quot;,
    &quot;version&quot;:[1,1,5,2]
  }
]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Each message can be broken into two pieces; first is presumably the notification - <em>event</em> - and the second is a hash with <em>myo</em>, <em>timestamp</em>, <em>type</em> and <em>version</em>.  The <em>timestamp</em> and <em>version</em> fields are self-explanatory.  I&#39;m not sure what the <em>myo</em> fields signifies yet.</p>

<p>The most useful field is the <em>type</em> field.  This field gives information about what the Myo is doing (or has already done I suppose is more accurate).</p>

<p>The event types I&#39;ve uncovered so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>paired</em> signifies that the Myo is paired to the bluetooth receiver</li>
<li><em>connected</em> signifies that the Myo has connected</li>
<li><em>unlocked</em> signifies that the Myo has received the thumb-to-middle-finger gesture which unlocks the Myo</li>
<li><em>arm_synced</em> signifies the initial gesture to connect the Myo has been successfully completed.  It also tells the arm that the Myo is on and the x_direction.</li>
<li><em>pose</em> gives information about the gesture itself.</li>
<li><em>orientation</em> provides <em>accelermoter</em>, <em>gyroscope</em> and and <em>orientation</em> details.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now the gem is very basic and can only provide feedback as to the gesture the Myo has received.  As I&#39;m still adding <em>types</em>, the Event Machine connection so far is just one big case switch.</p>

<p>Once the essential fields have been locked down (through some API research no doubt), it can be refactored into something more useful.</p>

<h3>Contribute</h3>

<p>I would encourage anyone who is interested in Myo or helping to develop a gem wrapper for Myo to fork or submit a pull request to: <a href="https://https://github.com/bgmarx/myo-ruby-wrapper">Myo Ruby Wrapper</a></p>
