I was fortunate enough to give a talk on Elixir in Production at the first Elixir meetup in San Francisco on July 15.

Here are the slides from the talk: [Elixir in Production](https://t.co/PLVC6PRhWm)

For the first Elixir meetup in SF the turnout was great.  There was even a waitlist of 30 people.  It bodes well for the future of Elixir and the community in San Francisco.
